Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me peko
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed peko
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb peko
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead peko
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming peko
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running peko
Didn't make sense not to live for fun peko
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb peko
So much to do, so much to see peko
So what's wrong with taking the back streets peko?
You'll never know if you don't go peko
You'll never shine if you don't glow peko
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play peko
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid peko
And all that glitters is gold peko
Only shooting stars break the mold peko
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder peko
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older peko
But the meteor men beg to differ peko
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture peko
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin peko
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim peko
My world's on fire, how about yours peko?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored peko
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play peko
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid peko
All that glitters is gold peko
Only shooting stars break the mold peko
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play peko
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid peko
And all that glitters is gold peko
Only shooting stars peko
Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas peko?
I need to get myself away from this place peko
I said, "Yup" what a concept peko
I could use a little fuel myself peko
And we could all use a little change peko
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming peko
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running peko
Didn't make sense not to live for fun peko
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb peko
So much to do, so much to see peko
So what's wrong with taking the back streets peko?
You'll never know if you don't go (go peko!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow peko
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play peko
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid peko
And all that glitters is gold peko
Only shooting stars break the mold peko
And all that glitters is gold peko
Only shooting stars break the mold peko
